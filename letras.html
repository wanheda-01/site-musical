          <h2>consequences</h2>
        
        

        <div class="letras">
          
   
<p> Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping,
Stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the souls that I can't listen to,
To tell the truth </p>

<p>oving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences</p>

<p>Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it</p>

<p>Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences</p>

<p>No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mhm</p>

<p>Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'cause loving you had consequences</p>

<h2>This Love</h2>



<div class="letras">


 <p> Na, na, na
No desire to make me miss ya
When I'm feeling sentimental
Going in our separate ways
But wind up back here in the middle
Losing you I couldn't face but to love you is worse
Waiting for you just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, na, na, na</p>

<p>Said it's the last time but na, na, na, na
Just like the last time yeah, na, na, na, na
Tired of building up my walls yeah
Just to watch them fall again so fuck</p>

<p>This love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who get's played
Again and again and again and again</p>

<p>Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person who just can't lose
If you're gonna leave then go
If you need me let me know
Love me or just let me go, but no</p>

<p>Na, na, na, na
Said it's the last time but na, na, na, na
Just like the last time yeah, na, na, na, na
Tired of building up my walls yeah
Just to watch them fall again</p>

<p>This love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who get's played
Again and again and again and again</p>

<p>Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you too
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
And there I go and fall again</p>

<p>This love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who get's played
Again and again and again and again and again</p>

<p>Oh, again
Oh, no
There I go again</p>
